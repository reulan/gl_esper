# The Esper
A young woman battling a recent bout of amnesia while learning more about her inner magical powers.				

## Overview
The Esper will start out like the other characters with two decks:
- Battle deck (of 11 cards)
- Negotiation deck (of 10 cards)

These cards will only have two upgrade options. (it would be cool to level cards more than once, but we'll see!)

## Battle - combat style
The Esper uses offensive and defensive magic to burn or addle her enemies, additionally she can imbue her spellblade with various properties if she needs to get up close
and personal.
- Black Magic (an array of fire magic to apply Burn and Scorch to her enemies)
- White Magic (self healing, damage reduction and status effect curing)

### Playstyles
Spellblade: Melee oriented version of the Esper with the goal of increasing spellblade level as much as possible to unlock additional effects on her melee
attacks and effects per battle. 
- Discard cards with Enchants to enhance her spellblade.
- Allows Melee attacks to increase by one level (up to a very powerful level 3 version of the card)


Fire Mage: Stacking cards that apply Burn and Scorch to enemies.

White Mage: Buff and sustains herself and party with healing magic, while disrupting her enemies with status effects.


### Grafts
TBD

## Negotiation
The Esper summons a wide variety of magical spirits to defeat her foes.

Core Argument: Magicite Shard
- Summons a random common Esper on negotiation start.

### Playstyles

### Grafts
TBD

## World additions (v2)
This section will be worked on after the Esper design has been completed.

### Other Cards
- Card Sets (eventually 10 sets of 6 cards - 3 battle/negotiation per)
- Status/Item cards.

### Perks
- Meta progression each run with unlockables up to Tier 5.

### Mutations
Meta modifications applied to the run.

I personally am a fan of having an option of a starting graft for either negotioan onr battles
Thematically, would be nice to be able to burn negotiation cards for enhanced battle effects. (based off - defeating Espers granting Magicite)

### People
- NPC's (with Boon/Banes)
- Party members
